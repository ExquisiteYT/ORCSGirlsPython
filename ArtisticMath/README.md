# Artistic Math

The activities use a modified version of [ColabTurtle](https://github.com/tolgaatam/ColabTurtle) developed by [Tolga Atam](https://github.com/tolgaatam). Here is a list of commands you can use to draw.

**`initializeTurtle(initial_speed=DEFAULT_SPEED, initial_window_size=DEFAULT_WINDOW_SIZE)`** Initializes the drawing display. This command needs to be called *first*. The parameters are options. For example `initializeTurtle()` will create a drawing area with the default size and drawing speed. To create a area of e.g. 1000 x 800 pixles, you would use the command `initializeTurtle(initial_window_size=(1000,800))`

**`forward(units)`** >Moved the turtle (pen) forward by the amount `units`. If the pen is down a line from the current to the new position will be drawn.

**`backward(units)`** Moved the turtle (pen) backward by the amount `units`. If the pen is down a line from the current to the new position will be drawn.

**`right(degrees)`**  Turns the direction of the turtle (pen) to the right by `degrees`.

**`face(degrees)`** Sets the direction or heading  of the turtle (pen) to `degrees`.

**`left(degrees)`** Turns the direction of the turtle (pen) to the left by `degrees`.
